As a user, I want to be able to grant inventory access to other users, so that I can share my inventory with my roommates.

I start by opening the web app and navigating to the “Fridge” I want to share. From there, I click on the “Share” button to open the sharing options.
I am then able to enter the email addresses of the individuals I want to share the “Fridge” with, as well as set their permissions for viewing or editing.

Once I have selected the appropriate sharing settings, I can then click "Send" to notify the individuals that the “Fridge” has been shared with them. The recipients will then receive an invitation to access the shared “Fridge”.

As the owner of the “Fridge”, I am able to monitor and control access to the “Fridge” by viewing the sharing settings and revoking access as necessary.
