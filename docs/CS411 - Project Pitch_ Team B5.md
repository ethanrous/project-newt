Project Pitch: Team B5


Idea 1: Used Textbook Marketplace
        Our first idea is a system that allows university students to buy and sell used textbooks directly from each other. This solution stems from the issue of high textbook costs to students, and when they go to return them to bookstores, they are offered pennies on the dollar. The program will connect to the GoogleBook API to create unified store pages per text. Additionally we will make requests to (an)other API(s) to optimize buyer/seller matching (locational services, recommended price, etc.). A database will be used to store information about the products themselves as well as user data to provide personalized recommendations[a]. Users will log in to the app using a third-party OAuth service (likely Google’s). This application will be focused on BU students only, and the books will be organized by department and course to offer users a streamlined experience in finding the correct product.

Idea 2: Recipe Recommendation Tool 
        Our second is a system that allows users to keep track of the ingredients in their pantry and fridge and uses that information to recommend recipes to the user. Upon creating an account and logging in to the app the user will be asked to input their ingredients into the app. We plan to make this easier for them by having a list of ingredients that people may have in their homes and allowing them to check off which ingredients they have. While inputting the ingredients the user will be asked to input the quantity and expiration date of their products. At the beginning of each week, the user will be sent a list of possible recipes that they can make with those ingredients based on their interests and diets (will display nutritional info). If the user does not have some ingredients for the recipe that they are interested in, the app automatically adds those ingredients to a shopping list that the user can either go buy themselves or order those ingredients using a food delivery app like Instacart. Each time the user goes grocery shopping they can scan their receipt to add their new items to their inventory. The user will have to create an account to store their inventory. They will also be able to add their friends and roommates to share what each person has in their inventory and the recipes that they’ve recreated. This can be used as a solution to food waste and indecisiveness in the kitchen.
