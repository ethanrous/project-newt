# MyFridge

MyFridge is a web-based application that allows a user to keep track of all the items in their fridge. This app is a useful tool to help users food reduce waste and simplifies the the process of planning meals based on the ingredients they have on hand.

## Features

<strong>Inventory Management: </strong> Users are able to add items to their fridges, edit the items that are already in their fridge, and remove items when they are used up or when they expire. The inventory system tracks the quantity, expiration date, and location of each item, making it easier for users to keep track of the food items in their fridge. Users are also able to view the nutritional data of the item, making it useful tool for meal prepping.

<strong>Recipe Search: </strong> Users are able to search for recipes based on the items in their fridges. They can enter the ingredients that they want to use up and the web app will give them a list of recipes that incorporate those ingredients. This allows users to easily find recipes using the ingredients that they already have, as a result reducing food waste.

<strong>Fridge Sharing: </strong> Users are able to share their fridges with other users, like friends, family, roommates, and/or coworkers. This allows users to keep track of which items belong to each user when sharing fridges in a common space like homes, dormitories, communal living spaces, offices, etc. 

<strong>Notification System: </strong> Users are able to view a list of items with their corresponding expiration dates, sorted from closest expiration date to furthest expiration date. This allows users to use up their ingredients before they expire to reduce food waste.

## Technologies Used

<strong>Frontend: </strong> The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<strong>Backend: </strong> The backend of the application is built using Python, the Flask web framework, and Jinja HTML Templates. It uses a MongoDB database to store the inventory, recipes, expiration dates, nutritional data, and user accounts.

<strong>APIs: </strong> The application used Nutrition by API-Ninjas to retrieve the nutritonal data for the ingredients and Recipe Search and Diet by Edamam to get recipes.
