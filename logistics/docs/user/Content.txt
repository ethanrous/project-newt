When viewing an ingredient/recipe,  want a variety of content related to the object. There should be images as well as nutritional information to help me plan my diet. I want to be able to quickly parse through my options and make easy decisions. I want to be able to view photos without clicking time to make searching for the perfect recipe easy.
Nutritional information should include macros (carbs, protein, fat) and a calorie count. This information should be accurate and I should not have to enter it myself. When I add ingredients to a recipe or adda recipe to my recipe book, it should track the macros and allow me to understand my diet.
