As a user, I want to be able to add, delete, and update items from my “Fridge” so that I can keep track of my inventory and grocery shop more efficiently.

To add a new item to my “Fridge”, I start by opening the web app and navigating to the “Fridge”. I then click on the "Add Item" button and enter the item name and quantity. I can also assign an expiration date to the item if necessary.

Once I have added the new item to my inventory, it will appear alongside my other items in the form of a list. As I consume items, I can update their remaining quantity.

If I need to delete an item from my “Fridge”, I can select it and click on the "Delete" button. The item will then be removed from my inventory and I will no longer receive reminders about it.

Overall, the ability to add and delete items from “Fridge” allows me to stay organized and makes it easier to manage my grocery shopping.
